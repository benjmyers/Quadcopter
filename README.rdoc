== Project
Quadcopter controlled with Arduino for Electronics II.

== Organization

- Control
Transmits accelerometer data from a Wii Nunchuck via an xBee radio. This data is used to control movement of the quadcopter.

- Nunchuck
Contains headerfiles needed for the Nunchuck.

- Quadcopter
Code for controlling the quadcopter. Including reading in data via xBee, reading on board data from accelerometer and gyroscope, and controlling the motors.

== Status
In early stages of development.
